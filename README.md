== Description ==

MailDepot is created to help increase email signups by letting visitors who want to download a file from your website, subscribe to an email list first.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin
4. Enter your MailChimp API and hit enter. That will bring up a dropdown menu of your email lists.
5. Select the list you want to use
6. Add the shortcode to your posts or pages. Shortcode example: [mailchimp_pdf file='http://www.yoursite.com/test.pdf'] 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin free? =

Yes, for now the plugin is completely free. We might develop premium features in the future, for which you might have to pay.

= What about other auto-responders, besides MailChimp? =

We are currently looking into which auto-responder system we can add.

= How do I change the "Download File" link text per file? =

By adding text='link text' to the shortcode like this: [mailchimp_pdf file='http://yoursite.com/test.pdf' text='Link TEXT']
